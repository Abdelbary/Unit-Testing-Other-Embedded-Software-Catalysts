### GPIO Project Requirements
* Each pin can be set as input/output
* Each pin can be set high or low
* Each pin can be read
* Each port can be read in one word
* Has init function to config defaults by pin
* Each pin can be configured for gpio
* Each pin can have its active polarity reversed
* We will support 32bits on port C.
* We will ignore other features for now (pulldown, pullup, interrupts, lock, etc)
